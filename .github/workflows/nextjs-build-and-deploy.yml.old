# # Define the events that trigger this workflow
# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - main  # Trigger on push events to the 'main' branch
#   pull_request:
#     branches:
#       - main  # Trigger on pull requests to the 'main' branch

# jobs:
#   build:
#     # Use the latest version of Ubuntu
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # Define the Node.js versions to use in the matrix
#     strategy:
#       matrix:
#         node-version: [16.x]

#     steps:
#       # Step 1: Check out the code from the repository
#       - name: Checkout code
#         uses: actions/checkout@v2

#       # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
#       - name: Set up Node.js
#         uses: actions/setup-node@v2
#         with:
#           node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}  # Use the version defined in the matrix
#           cache: 'pnpm'  # Cache pnpm dependencies

#       # Step 3: Install pnpm (an alternative package manager)
#       - name: Install pnpm
#         run: npm install -g pnpm

#       # Step 4: Install project dependencies using pnpm
#       - name: Install dependencies
#         run: pnpm install

#       # Step 5: Build the project
#       - name: Build project
#         run: pnpm next build

#       # Step 6: Upload build artifacts (for example, to use in a deployment step)
#       - name: Upload build artifacts
#         if: success()  # Only run this step if the previous steps were successful
#         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
#         with:
#           name: build  # Name of the artifact
#           path: .next  # Path to the build artifacts

#   # Additional jobs for deployment can be added here
